15,Axis axis crossing the road,"The chital or cheetal (Axis axis), also known as chital deer, spotted deer or axis deer is a deer which commonly inhabits wooded regions of Sri Lanka, Nepal,  Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, and in small numbers in Pakistan. It is the most common deer species in Indian forests. The name Chital comes from the Bengali word Chitral (চিত্রল)/Chitra (চিত্রা), which means ""spotted"". The chital is monotypic within the genus Axis, but this genus has also included three species that now are moved to Hyelaphus based on genetic evidence.


The Picture was taken in Nagarhole NP of India where they thrive in huge numbers. The picture shows Axis axis crossing a road which pass through the national park right in front of a wildlife crossing board. Through this picture I wanted to showcase that wildlife crossing and vehicle drivers should be more careful on the road to prevent road kills."

There is doubt about the number of possible species or subspecies of Furcifer pardalis. There may be as many as fourteen. The males can be described as colour morphs or forms; the females with their cryptic colouring are very difficult to tell apart. At the moment, the safest definition is to define locale or specific location."
